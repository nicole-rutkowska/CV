        <p>Since over two years I have been providing system support for an
           international logistics application - finding the root causes of problems
           is everyday life for me.
           <br>
           Thanks to high analytical skills and a passion for solving riddles,
           I solve user issues effectively and readily.
           <br>
           Working in English and the possibility of continuous development gives me
           professional satisfaction. </p></td>
